# gdf Plugin Hooks Disabled

This file disables gdf plugin hooks for this repository.

## What it does

When this file (`.gdf-hooks-disabled`) exists in the repository root, the
`claude-hook-wrapper.sh` script from the gdf plugin will exit immediately
without running any validation commands (fmt, lint, test, etc.).

This only affects hooks configured by the gdf (grumps dotfiles) plugin.
Other Claude Code hooks will continue to work normally.

## Usage

To disable gdf hooks in a repository:

```bash
# Copy this file to your repository root
cp ~/.claude-dotfiles/examples/.gdf-hooks-disabled .gdf-hooks-disabled

# Or create it manually
touch .gdf-hooks-disabled
```

## When to use this

- **Legacy codebases**: Projects with existing code that doesn't pass linters
- **Large repositories**: When validation takes too long in hooks
- **Special workflows**: Projects with custom CI/CD that handles validation
- **Temporary debugging**: Disable hooks while troubleshooting issues

## Alternative: Customize validation

Instead of disabling hooks entirely, you can customize the validation commands
in your `justfile`:

```just
# Minimal validation for legacy code
lint:
  @echo "✅ Lint check skipped (legacy codebase)"

test:
  @echo "✅ Tests skipped (run in CI)"

fmt:
  # Only format new files
  git diff --name-only --cached | xargs prettier --write
```

## Re-enabling hooks

Simply remove this file:

```bash
rm .gdf-hooks-disabled
```

## Note

This file can be committed to version control to disable gdf hooks for all
contributors, or kept local (add to `.gitignore`) to disable only for yourself.

Remember: This only disables the gdf plugin's hooks. If you have other Claude
Code hooks configured in `.claude/settings.json` or globally in
`~/.claude/settings.json`, those will continue to run.
